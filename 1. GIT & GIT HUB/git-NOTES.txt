🧩 (1) Basics :
------------------

Q1. What is Git?
- Git is a distributed version control tool. it is :
                                              - popular
                                              - free & open source
                                              - fast & scalable
- it used to :
            - track changes in source code.
            - manage project history.
            - enable collaboration among multiple developers.


Q2. What is GitHub?
it is a website that allows developers to store and manage thier code using git.


INSTALLATION & GUIS
####################

Git/gitbash for downloads:      http://git-scm.com

To verify Installation  : git --version    or    git -v



SETUP
########
Configuring user information used across all local repositories.

1️⃣ See Current Configured User (for this repo) :
                                       git config user.name
                                       git config user.email
          if not configure then Sirf Current Repository ke liye (Local Config) :
                                                                       git config user.name "Meraz Alam"
                                                                       git config user.email "merazalam18011998@gmail.com"
          Local Configuration Update (Only Current Project) :
                                                          cd your-project-folder
                                                          git config --local user.name "Office Name"
                                                          git config --local user.email "office@gmail.com"
                                                                      If you are inside project folder, you can also just write:
                                                                                                                     git config user.name "New Name"
                                                                                                                     git config user.email "newemail@gmail.com"

2️⃣ See Global Configured User (for entire system) :
                                             git config --global user.name
                                             git config --global user.email
                        if not configure then Puri System ke liye (Global Config) :
                                                                       git config --global user.name "Meraz Alam"
                                                                       git config --global user.email "merazalam18011998@gmail.com"
                        Global Configuration Update :
                                                  git config --global user.name "New Name"
                                                  git config --global user.email "newemail@gmail.com"
3️⃣ See All Git Configuration (Very Important) :
                                         git config --list
4️⃣ See Where Config is Coming From (Advanced / Interview Level) :
                                          git config --list --show-origin
                    - This tells whether config is from:
                                                    global (~/.gitconfig)
                                                    local (.git/config)
                                                    system
                           
                             



SETUP & INIT
#############
Configuring user information, initializing and cloning repositories.

1. retrieve an entire repository(project) from a hosted location via URL :
                                                               git clone [url]
2. To located current Directory(folder) :
                                      cd project-foldername
                                      ls  or ls -a 
                                       Note: -a help us to see all files including hidden files.
3. initialize an existing directory(folder) as a Git repository :
                                                            git init  
     git init
     --------
     - used to create new git repository
     - jab hum start hee krte hai local se or bad me github pe jate hai to phle local me track rkhne ke liye ye git init use me ata hai.


STAGE & SNAPSHOT
#################
Working with snapshots and the Git staging area.

git status
-----------
show modified files in working directory, staged for your next commit.

Note:- jab v hum git status ko use krte hai to generally 4 types ke status show hoti hai:
                                                                       1. untracked  : new files that git doesn't yet trak.
                                                                       2. modified   : changed
                                                                       3. staged     : file is ready to be commited.
                                                                       4. unmodified : unchanged. 

git add [file]
--------------
git add file ke changes ko staging area (index) me daalta hai —taaki wo next commit me include ho sake.

git restore --staged file.txt 
--------------------------------
Ye command staging area se file ko hata deta hai,lekin file ke andar ke changes delete nahi karta.

git restore file.txt
--------------------
File ko last commit wali state me wapas la deta hai aur current uncommitted changes ko hata deta hai modified status(sirf change hua hai na to add or na commit) se.


git diff
---------
diff of what is changed but not staged


git diff --staged
------------------
matlab jo files staging area me add ho chuki hain unka diff.


git commit -m “[descriptive message]”
-------------------------------------
commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot


git reset --soft HEAD~1
-------------------------
- agar tum commit ho chuki changes ko wapas staging area me lana chahte ho.
- Matlab situation aisi ho jayegi jaise tumne git add kiya ho lekin commit nahi kiya ho.
- Ye tab safe hai jab commit abhi push nahi hua ho.
- Ye kya karega :
               ❌ Last commit hata dega
               ✅ Saare changes wapas staging area me aa jayenge
               ✅ Code delete nahi hoga
| Tum kya chahte ho                         | Command                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Sirf commit undo, changes staging me rahe | `git reset --soft HEAD~1` |
| Commit undo, changes unstaged ho jaye     | `git reset HEAD~1`        |




SHARE & UPDATE
###############
Retrieving updates from another repository and updating local repos

     git remote add origin <link-of-repo>
     -------------------------------------
        - Ye command tumhare local repository ko ek remote repository (GitHub) se connect karta hai.
        - Breakdown :
                    -  | Part      | Meaning                                |
                       | --------- | -------------------------------------- |
                       | git       | Git tool                               |
                       | remote    | Remote repository manage karne ke liye |
                       | add       | Naya remote add karna                  |
                       | origin    | Remote ka naam (default name)          |
                       | repo link | GitHub ka URL                          |

      git remote -v
      --------------
      - git remote -v tumhe batata hai ki tumhara local Git repository kis remote repository (jaise GitHub) se connected hai — aur uska URL kya hai.
      - Example Output :
                  origin  https://github.com/meraz/demo.git (fetch)
                  origin  https://github.com/meraz/demo.git (push)




    git push [alias] [branch]  /  git push -u [alias] [branch]
    --------------------------------------------------------
    - upload local repo content to remote repo.
    - here -u it is short form for future use taaki lambe time tak isi branch pe kam krna pde to sirf git push hee likhna pde.














BRANCH & MERGE
###############
✅ Branch : Branch Git me ek alag working line hoti hai jahan hum independently development kar sakte hain bina main code ko affect kiye.
✅ Merge : Merge ka matlab hai ek branch ke changes ko dusri branch me combine karna.

    git branch
    ----------
     - local branche repository ki saari branches ko list karti hai.jis bhi current active branch me app hai uski.
     - Aur * se current active branch ko show karta hai.


   git branch <new-branch-name>
   ----------------------------
     - Ye new branch bana dega.
     - Par tum abhi bhi current branch me hi rahoge.


   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
   -------------------------------
    - ye new branch bna dega or sath-sath aap isi branch pe switch v kr jayenge.


   git branch -m <branch-name>
   -------------------------------
   - to rename branch


   git switch <branch-name>
   ------------------------
   - Modern Way to Switch Branch.


   git branch -d <branch-name>
   ----------------------------
   - to delete branch.
   Note:- jis branch me hai usi branch ko nhi delete kr skte phle kisi aur branch me switch krna pdega.







Q4. What type of version control system is Git?
 - Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS).
 - That means every developer has a complete copy of the project’s code and history on their own computer — not just the latest version.

Q5. Difference between Centralized VCS and Distributed VCS ?
| Type                | Description                                          | Example  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| **Centralized VCS** | One main server holds all code; others depend on it. | SVN, CVS |
| **Distributed VCS** | Every developer has a full copy of code & history.   | Git      |

Q6. What are repositories in Git?
     - A repository (repo) in Git is a storage location where your project’s files and their complete version history are kept.
     - It helps you track changes, switch between versions, and collaborate with others.
Types of Repositories:
     - Local Repository:
               - Stored on your own computer.
               - You create it using git init or by cloning another repo.
               - Example: C:\Projects\MyApp\.git
     - Remote Repository:
               - Stored on a server (like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
               - Used to share your code with others.
               - Example: https://github.com/username/MyApp.git
Example Commands:
git init                     # Create a new local repository
git clone <repo-url>         # Copy a remote repo to your local machine
git remote add origin <url>  # Link your local repo to a remote one


Q7. Explain of Git Architecture in detail?
  - Working Tree :
               The Working Tree (also called the Working Directory or Workspace) is where all the files for your project are stored on your local machine.
  - Staging Area :
            The Staging Area (also called the Index) is where files are prepared before being committed to the repository.
            When you make changes in your working directory and want to save them to the local repository, you first add them to the staging area using the git             add command.Once files are in the staging area, they are ready to be committed. The staging area holds a snapshot of your changes 
            and prepares them for the next commit.
            In short, it's a "pre-commit" area where you gather all the changes you want to be part of the next commit.
  - Local Repository :
               The Local Repository is the place where Git stores all your project’s history. It's stored on your local machine.When you commit changes (git                   commit), the changes are recorded into your local repository.This local repository contains a .git folder  that holds all of the project’s                      version history, Contains commits, branches, tags.
  - Central Repository :
                The Central Repository (also called the Remote Repository) is usually hosted on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.Optional — a                       repository on a server like GitHub for collaboration.
  - Objects in Git: 
              Git stores data as objects:
                     - Blob: Stores file content
                     - Tree: Stores folder structure
                     - Commit: Stores metadata (author, message, parent commits)
                     - Tag: Named pointer to a commit
  - HEAD: 
      Points to the current branch or commit.


Q8. What are commits in Git?
A commit in Git is like a snapshot of your project at a particular point in time.
It records what changes were made, who made them, and when.


Q9. What is the staging area (or index) in Git?
The staging area is a temporary place where you prepare changes before committing them to the repository.
In simple words: It’s like a waiting area for changes you want to save in Git.
EX-
git add file.txt   # Move changes to staging area
git commit -m "Save changes"  # Commit from staging to repository


Q10. What is a branch in Git?
A branch is a separate path of development in Git. It allows you to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main code.
In simple words: Think of a branch as a parallel version of your project.

Q11. What is a merge in Git?
A merge in Git is the process of combining changes from one branch into another.
In simple words: It brings updates from different branches together.


Q12. Explain the Git workflow (Working Directory → Staging → Repository).
Git workflow describes how changes move from your files to the repository:
In simple words : Work → Prepare → Save — that’s the Git workflow.
               - Working Directory: Where you edit files on your computer.
               - Staging Area (Index): Where you prepare changes for commit (git add).
               - Repository: Where commits are saved permanently (git commit).
Example :
        # Edit files → Stage changes → Commit to repository
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Save changes"


Q13. What is a distributed version control system?
A Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) is a system where every developer has a full copy of the repository, including its entire history.
Key Points :
     - No single point of failure.
     - Allows offline work.
     - Changes can later be pushed or pulled to/from a remote repository.



Q14. What is the difference between git clone, git pull and git fetch?
Git clone :
------------
- Purpose: Downloads a copy of an existing Git repository (usually from a remote central repository) to your local system.
- Usage: This command is typically used when you want to start working on an existing project and need a copy of the central repository on your machine.
- Example: git clone https://github.com/username/project.git

Git pull :
-----------
- Purpose: Fetches and merges changes from the central repository to your local repository.
- Usage: Use this to keep your local repository up to date with changes made by other collaborators. However, conflicts may arise if your local changes clash with those on the central repo.
- Note: Conflicts occur when there are changes in the same part of a file in both your local and the central repository. You’ll need to manually resolve these conflicts.
- Example : git pull origin feature1

Git fetch :
------------
- Downloads the latest changes from the remote repository but does not merge them into your working branch.
- This is a safe operation because it allows you to review the changes before merging.
- The fetched changes are stored in origin/<branch>, and you can manually merge them when ready.
- Example : git fetch origin main


Q15. What is the difference between a commit, branch, tag, and HEAD in Git ? 
🔹 Commit
------------
- A snapshot of your project at a point in time.
- Think of it like saving a file version with a unique ID (SHA hash).
- Example: "This commit saved the code after fixing a bug."
🔹 Branch
------------
- A pointer (or label) to a series of commits.
- The default branch is usually main or master.
- Used to develop features separately without disturbing the main code.
- Example: feature/login branch for login functionality.
🔹 Tag
--------
- A pointer to a specific commit (usually a release point).
- Unlike branches, tags don’t move — they’re fixed.
- Commonly used for marking versions like v1.0, v2.0.
🔹 HEAD
----------
- A special pointer that tells where you currently are in the repo.
- Usually, it points to the latest commit of the current branch.
- Example: If you’re on branch main, HEAD points to the tip of main.








⚙️ (2) Installation & Setup :
-------------------------------

Q1. How do you install Git on Windows/Linux/Mac?
-  Install git in local system
-  Configure name & email using following commands (One time configuration)
              git config --global user.name ""
              git config --global user.email ""
- Verify configuration:
              git config --global --list

Q2. How to check Git version?
run this command in Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal:
git --version

Q3. How to configure username and email in Git?
Before committing code, Git needs to know who you are. You can configure your name and email with these commands:
                       git config --global user.name "Your Name"
                       git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
Verify Configuration:  git config --global --list
Notes:
--global → Applies to all repositories on your system.
To configure for one specific repository only, skip --global and run the commands inside that repo.
                       git config user.name "Your Name"
                       git config user.email "youremail@example.com"
Verify Configuration:  git config --list 

Q4. Where are Git configurations stored?
1️⃣ System-Level Configuration :
      - The system config file usually already exists when Git is installed.
      - It stores default Git settings for all users on the machine.
      - You usually don’t need to manually create it.
      - View or modify:
git config --system --list
git config --system user.name "System Name"
2️⃣ Global-Level Configuration
      - Stored in your home directory: ~/.gitconfig (Linux/Mac) or C:\Users\<username>\.gitconfig (Windows).
      - Created automatically the first time you run a global configuration command, like:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
3️⃣ Local-Level Configuration
      - Stored inside each repository in .git/config.
      - Created automatically when you initialize a Git repository:
            git init

Q5. What is the purpose of .gitconfig file?
The .gitconfig file is where Git stores configuration settings. It tells Git how to behave for a user or repository.
Purpose:
   - Identity settings: Your name and email (user.name, user.email) for commits.
   - Preferences: Editor, merge tool, line endings, colors, aliases, etc.
   - Behavior: Settings for push, pull, fetch, rebase, etc.
   - Scope: Can exist at three levels:
              - System → Applies to all users on the computer
              - Global → Applies to your user account
              - Local → Applies only to a specific repository

Q6. How do you initialize a new Git repository?
To start tracking a project with Git, you initialize a repository in your project folder.
Steps:
  - Go to your project folder: cd path/to/your/project
  - Initialize Git repository: git init
                                     - This creates a hidden .git folder inside your project.
                                     - Git now starts tracking changes in this folder.
  - Verify repository: git status

Q7. How do you clone an existing repository?
Cloning means copying a remote repository (like from GitHub) to your local machine.
Steps:
   - Get the repository URL
         - Example: https://github.com/username/project.git
   - Run the clone command:
         - git clone https://github.com/username/project.git

Q8. What is the command to check current Git configuration?
    - Check all Git configurations (local + global + system) for the current repo: git config --list
    - Check global configurations only: git config --global --list
    - Check a specific setting:   git config user.name    ,    git config user.email






🧱 (3) Core Git Commands :
----------------------------


Q1. What does git init do?
   - git init starts a new Git repository in your project folder.
   - It creates a hidden .git folder where Git stores all information about your project history.
   - After running git init, Git can track changes in your files.
   - Example : git init

Q2. What does git clone do?
   - git clone copies an existing Git repository (like from GitHub) to your computer.
   - It downloads all files, branches, and history.
   - You can start working on the project locally.
   - Example : git clone https://github.com/username/project.git

Q3. What is git add used for?
   - git add moves changes from your working folder to the staging area.
   - It tells Git, “I want to include these changes in the next commit.”
   - Without git add, Git won’t include your changes in a commit.
   - Example : 
git add file.txt        # Stage a single file
git add .               # Stage all changed files in the folder


Q4. What does git commit do?
   - git commit saves a snapshot of your staged changes in the repository.
   - It records what changed, who changed it, and when.
   - Each commit has a unique ID to track history.
   - Example : git commit -m "Add homepage design"

Q5. What does git status show?
   - git status shows the current state of your repository.
   - Which files are modified, staged, or untracked.
   - Tells you what will be included in the next commit.
   - Example: git status
Output Example:
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   index.html
Changes not staged for commit:
        modified:   style.css
Untracked files:
        script.js

Q6. What does git log display?
 - git log shows the history of commits in your repository.
 - It lists each commit with:
                     - Commit ID (hash)
                     - Author name
                     - Date and time
                     - Commit message
 - Example : git log
Output Example:
commit 9fceb02
Author: John Doe <john@example.com>
Date:   Tue Oct 1 12:34:56 2025 +0530
    Add homepage design

Q7. What is git diff used for?
 - git diff = Compare your current work with the last saved version.
 - Helps you see what has changed line by line.
 - Can be used before committing to review changes.
Example:
git diff              # Changes not staged
git diff --staged     # Changes staged for next commit


Q8. What is git reset and its different modes (--soft, --mixed, --hard)?
git reset undoes changes in Git by moving the HEAD (current commit pointer) to an earlier commit.
There are three main modes:
 - --soft
       - Moves HEAD to a previous commit but keeps changes staged.
       - Good if you want to redo a commit without losing work. 
       - command : git reset --soft <commit_id>
 - --mixed (default)
       - Moves HEAD to a previous commit and unstages changes, but keeps changes in the working folder.
       - Good if you want to unstage files.
       - command : git reset --mixed <commit_id>     or git reset <commit_id>
 - --hard
       - Moves HEAD to a previous commit and discards all changes in staging and working folder.
       - Be careful: You will lose uncommitted work.
       - command : git reset --hard <commit_id>

Q9. What is git revert?
  - git revert is used to undo a commit safely by creating a new commit that cancels the changes made in a previous commit.
  - It does not delete history, it just adds a new commit to fix the old one.
  - Example: git revert <commit_id>

Q10. What does git checkout do?
git checkout is used to switch between branches or restore files to a previous version.
Example :
git checkout main              # Switch to main branch  
git checkout -b new-feature    # Create and switch to new branch  
git checkout filename.txt      # Restore a file to last saved version  


Q11. What does git rm do?
git rm is used to remove files from the working directory and from Git tracking.
Example :
git rm file.txt          # Remove file from working directory and Git  
git rm --cached file.txt # Remove file only from Git tracking (keep it locally)  


Q12. What does git mv do?
git mv is used to rename or move a file or folder in a Git repository.
Example :
git mv oldname.txt newname.txt     # Rename a file  
git mv file.txt folder/            # Move file to another folder  

Q13. How do you check the history of commits for a file in Git ?
- git log -- file.txt  :  See commits that changed the file.
- git log --oneline -- <filename> : Show commit history in one line
- git log -p -- file.txt :  See changes inside the file.
- git blame file.txt :  See which commit/author last modified each line.

Q14. How do you undo the last commit (but keep the changes)?
- If you want to remove the commit but keep all the file changes in your working directory :
    -  git reset --soft HEAD~1

Q15. How do you undo the last commit (and discard the changes)?
- If you want to remove the last commit completely and also throw away all its changes :
    - git reset --hard HEAD~1

Q16. How do you stage only part of a file in Git ?
- Using git add -p (patch mode) : 
   ex - git add -p file.txt  when run now Git shows each change (called a hunk) in file.txt.
                                                                                  For each hunk, you choose:
                                                                                                    - y → stage this hunk
                                                                                                    - n → don’t stage
                                                                                                    - s → split into smaller hunks
                                                                                                    - q → quit
- Using Interactive Mode :
    ex- git add -i



Q17. How do you see the difference between two commits ?
git diff <commit1> <commit2>  : Shows the line-by-line changes between the snapshots.
git diff --name-only <commit1> <commit2> : See names of changed files only







🌿 (4) Branching & Merging :
------------------------------

Q1. What is branching in Git?
Branching in Git means creating a separate line of development to work on new features or fixes without changing the main code.
Example : git branch feature-login

Q2. How to create a new branch?
You can create a new branch using the git branch command.
Example :
git branch feature-login
To switch to it:
git checkout feature-login

Q3. How to switch between branches?
You can switch between branches using the git checkout or git switch command.
git checkout branch-name     → Switch branch  
git switch branch-name       → Switch branch (new way)
git checkout -b new-branch   → Create & switch  
git switch -c new-branch     → Create & switch


Q4. What is merging in Git?
Merging in Git means combining changes from one branch into another.
 - Switch to the branch you want to merge into (usually main or master):   
                                                                 git checkout main
 - Merge the other branch into it: 
                        git merge feature-login
Note: - If there are conflicts, Git will ask you to resolve them manually before completing the merge.After resolving conflicts, you commit the merge:
git add .
git commit


Q5. What is a merge conflict and how do you resolve it?
merge conflict : 
            - A merge conflict happens when Git cannot automatically combine changes from two branches because the same part of a file was changed differently.
Steps to Resolve Merge Conflicts :
STEP-1
*******
Merge branches : like, 
           git checkout main
           git merge feature
 Note:- If there are conflicts, Git will show.
STEP-2
*******
Open conflicted files : Look for conflict markers in the file
STEP-3
*******
Decide which changes to keep : connected to the developers if other developers were involved, try to ask him what is code all about then find the conculusion is there any sequence to ,in which code need to be keept if sequence need to be kept accordingly we arrange the code.
STEP-4
*******
Mark file as resolved : like, git add file.txt
STEP-5
*******
Complete the merge : git commit


Q6. Difference between git merge and git rebase?
Git Merge :
------------
- Combines changes from one branch into another.
- Creates an extra commit (merge commit).
- Preserves the history of both branches as they are.
- Merge command :
   git checkout main
   git merge feature-login
here, Combines feature-login branch into main.Creates a merge commit.
Git Rebase :
-------------
- Moves (re-applies) commits of one branch on top of another branch.
- Rewrites history (no merge commit).
- Makes the commit history linear and clean.
- Rebase command :
        git checkout feature-login
        git rebase main
here , Moves feature-login commits on top of <main>.Makes history linear. "on top of main " : Git takes all commits from feature-login and re-applies them after the latest commit on main.
ex- 
Before rebase:
main: A --- B --- C
feature-login: D --- E
After git rebase main:
main: A --- B --- C
feature-login: D' --- E'      # Notice D and E are now after C.
After rebase, you may need to force push if the branch is already on remote:  git push --force
Note: 
🔹 When to Use?
Use Merge → When working in teams, and you want to keep the true history.
Use Rebase → When you want a clean, linear history (often before pushing code, or in personal branches).

 
Q7. How to delete a branch locally and remotely?
Delete a branch locally :
👉 Safe delete (won’t delete if all its commits are merged (usually in main or master)) suppose you want deletion of this   branch git branch -d feature-login
If feature-login was already merged into main, it will delete safely.
If not merged, Git will prevent deletion.
-   git branch -d branch-name  
👉 Force delete
-   git branch -D branch-name
Delete a branch on remote :
-   git push origin --delete branch-name


Q8. What is a fast-forward merge?
there are two types of Git merges :
Fast-Forward Merge :
---------------------
 - Happens when the branch you are merging is directly ahead of the branch you’re on.
 - No new commits exist on the target branch since branching.
 - Git just moves the branch pointer forward — no extra merge commit is created.
 - Example : 
           main:   A---B
            feature:    \
                         C---D
   NOTE : Merging feature into main (no new commits on main) → just moving main pointer to D.
Three-Way Merge :
-------------------
- Happens when both branches have new commits after branching.
- Situation Before Merge :
main:    A---B---E   (HEAD points here)
feature:    \
             C---D
NOTE :  Git looks at three commits:
                           - Common ancestor → B
                           - Head commit → “Head commit of current branch (E)
                           - Head commit of merging branch → D (feature)
* Git combines changes from B → E and B → D. It then creates a new commit M on the branch you merged into (here: main).
- Situation After Merge :
main:    A---B---E
             \     \
              C---D-M   (M is created on main)


Q9. What is a detached HEAD state?
Normally, HEAD points to the latest commit of a branch (e.g., main, dev).
But sometimes you checkout a commit directly (instead of a branch). Then HEAD points to a commit, not a branch.
This is called detached HEAD state.
ex- git checkout a1b2c3d(commit hash)
Note:- If you make commits in detached HEAD and want to keep them: git checkout -b new-branch-name (this branch)
- Normal HEAD → Points to a branch (which points to a commit).
- Detached HEAD → Points directly to a commit, not a branch.


Q10. How to stash your changes and apply them later? (git stash)
git stash saves your uncommitted changes temporarily so you can work on something else and apply them later.
 - Stash your changes:
      - command : git stash
      - explanation : Saves changes in a stack and clears your working folder.
 - List stashed changes:
      - command : git stash list
      - explanation : Shows all saved stashes.
 - Apply the last stashed changes:
      - command : git stash apply
      - explanation : Applies changes but keeps the stash in the list.
 - Apply and remove the stash:
      - command : git stash pop
      - explanation : Applies changes and removes it from the stash list.
 - Clear all stashes: 
      - command : git stash clear


Q11. Suppose you want to apply a specific commit from another branch to your current branch — how would you do that in Git?
cherry-pick : 
-------------
Cherry-pick in Git means applying a specific commit from one branch into another branch, without merging the whole branch.
   commands : git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
Example :
Suppose you are on main branch:  git checkout main
You see a useful commit (abc123) in feature branch that you want in main: git log feature
Apply that commit: git cherry-pick abc123
Note:- Now main has that commit, even without merging the entire feature branch.


Q12. How Much Branches was there in your projects?
-  How Much Branches was there in your projects: 
                - features (for adding new features)
                - R & D ( for adding some extra thing to make better application)
                - Hot fix ( serious problem)
                - bug fix ( for fixing bugs).... etc


Q13. How many branches you have created ( at a given time )?
 - How many branches you have created ( at a given time )
       1 ,2 or 3
- tell me procedure to fix a bug ?
firstly from bug fix branch , i created one more branch (sub branch) like bug-fix-jira-3456-login-error and work in this branch , once after fixed bug
then i have done PR (pull request) 









☁️ (5) Remote Repositories (GitHub Integration) :
----------------------------------------------------

Q1. How do you connect a local repo to a remote GitHub repository?
using this command:
   git remote add origin <remote-repo-URL>

Q2. What is git remote add origin used for?
 - It is used to add a remote connection (usually called origin) to your local Git repo.
 - It tells Git where to push and pull code from.
 - origin is just a name given to the remote repository.

Q3. How to push your code to GitHub?
First, make sure your repo is connected to GitHub.
Then run these commands:
                         git add .
                         git commit -m "Initial commit"
                         git push -u origin main

Q4. Difference between git push and git pull?
    git push: Uploads your local changes to the remote GitHub repo.
    git pull: Downloads and merges the latest changes from the remote repo to your local branch.

Q5. What is Fork? And how do you fork a repository and create a pull request in GitHub?
Fork :
--------
- Forking means creating your own copy of someone else’s GitHub repository.

after forking create a pull request in GitHub :
------------------------------------------------
 STEP-1 :
   - Go to the repo on GitHub.
   - Click Fork (top-right corner).
   - This makes a copy of the repo in your GitHub account.
STEP-2 :
    - Clone Your Fork Locally
STEP-3 :
    - Create a another Branch from it. (good practice)
STEP-4 :
    - Make Changes & Commit
STEP-5 :
    - Push Branch to Your Fork
STEP-6 :
     - Create a Pull Request (PR) :
                 - Go to your fork on GitHub.
                 - Click Compare & pull request.
                                             Choose:
                                                 - Base repository → the original repo (where you want to contribute).
                                                 - Head repository → your fork & branch.
                                                 - Add description and submit the Pull Request.

NOTE :- IN SHORT     := Fork → Clone → Branch → Commit → Push → Pull Request  


Q6. What is a Pull Request (PR)?
A Pull Request is a request to merge your code changes into another branch or repository.
It’s used for code review before merging changes.
Example: When you fork a repo, make updates, and then want the owner to include your changes — you send a PR.

Q7. What is the difference between Fork and Clone?
| Action    | Description                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fork**  | Makes a copy of a repo **on GitHub** (remote).     |
| **Clone** | Makes a copy of a repo **on your local computer**. |


Q8. How do you review or merge a Pull Request?
Create PR:
     - After pushing code to your branch (or forked repo), click “Compare & pull request” to open a PR from your branch → to the main repo’s branch (e.g., main or develop).
Open PR for Review:
     - Go to the Pull Requests tab of the target repository and select the PR you want to review.
Review Changes:
     - Check the Files changed, Commits, and add comments or feedback if needed.
Approve or Request Changes:
     - Reviewer clicks Review changes → choose Approve, Comment, or Request changes.
Merge PR:
     - If approved, click Merge pull request → Confirm merge, then delete the source branch and pull latest code locally.


Q9. What are GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions are used to automate workflows like testing, building, or deploying code.
For example:
You can set up an Action to automatically run tests whenever you push code or open a PR.
Workflow file:
     - You define automation steps inside a .yml file located in .github/workflows/.
     - Example: ci.yml
Triggers (Events):
     - The workflow runs when a specific event happens — like push, pull_request, or merge.
Jobs and Steps:
     - A workflow has jobs, and each job runs a series of steps (like running tests or building code).
     - These steps execute in GitHub-hosted virtual machines (Linux, Windows, or macOS).
Runners:
     - The actual commands are executed on a runner (a VM provided by GitHub or your own machine).
Example:  see example by cliking in github on action tab


Q10. What are Issues and Discussions in GitHub?
           Issues: Used to report bugs, suggest features, or track tasks.
           Discussions: Used for open conversations, questions, or planning ideas.
Example:
If something is broken → open an Issue.
If you want to talk about a new feature → start a Discussion.




















(14) What is the difference between a local branch and a remote-tracking branch?
###################################################################################
Local Branch :
---------------
- A branch that exists on your local machine.
- You can commit, switch, and modify it freely.
- Example: main, feature/login on your computer.
- Commands:
    git branch          # lists all local branches
    git checkout main   # switch to a local branch
    git commit -m "..." # commit on a local branch
Remote-Tracking Branch :
-------------------------
- A branch that tracks a branch on a remote repository (like GitHub).
- You cannot commit directly to it locally.
- Used to see the latest state of the remote branch.
- Naming: origin/main, origin/feature/login
- Commands:
     git fetch           # update remote-tracking branches
     git merge origin/main   # merge remote changes into local









(17) What are Git workflows (Git Flow, GitHub Flow, trunk-based development)?
##############################################################################
Git Workflows : 
---------------
Workflows define how teams use branches to collaborate in Git.

The three most popular ones are:
--------------------------------
 a. Git Flow :
***************
- Best for: Large projects with planned releases.
- Branching model:
     - main (or master) → production-ready code
     - develop → integration branch (where features merge before release)
     - feature/* → for new features
     - release/* → for preparing a release
     - hotfix/* → for urgent fixes in production
b. GitHub Flow :
*****************
- Best for: Continuous deployment, small-to-medium teams.
- Branching model:
      - main → always deployable
      - Create a short-lived feature branch (feature/login)
      - Open a Pull Request (PR) → get reviewed → merge back into main
c. Trunk-Based Development :
******************************
- Best for: Agile, DevOps, CI/CD teams.
- Branching model:
        - Developers commit directly to main (trunk) or very short-lived branches.
        - Frequent small commits → continuously integrated.





           







(24) How do you squash multiple commits into one?
####################################################
- Interactive Rebase (most common) :  
       like, git rebase -i HEAD~N  here Replace N with how many commits you want to squash.
- now 
An editor opens showing something like:
pick a1b2c3 First commit
pick d4e5f6 Second commit
pick 789abc Third commit
Change the word pick to squash (or s) for the commits you want to merge into the first:
pick a1b2c3 First commit
squash d4e5f6 Second commit
squash 789abc Third commit
- Git will then let you edit the commit message → combine or rewrite as needed.
- Save and exit → Git creates one single commit.




(26) How do you set up .gitignore and what is it used for?
#############################################################
gitignore :
---------------
-  .gitignore is a plain text file in your Git repository.
- It tells Git which files/folders to ignore (not track).
- Useful for things like:
                - build artifacts (/target, /dist)
                - IDE files (.idea/, .vscode/)
                - OS files (Thumbs.db, .DS_Store)
                - secrets (*.env, *.key)
How to Set It Up :
-------------------
- Create a file named .gitignore in your repository root:  touch .gitignore
- Add patterns of files/folders you want Git to ignore. Example :
# Ignore build directory
/target/

# Ignore log files
*.log

# Ignore environment files
.env

# Ignore IDE configs
.idea/
*.iml
- Save it and commit 
- Important Notes  :
                 - .gitignore only affects untracked files.
                 - If you already tracked a file, Git won’t ignore it automatically. To fix: git rm --cached filename



(27) What is the difference between git log and git reflog?
############################################################
git log :
-----------
- Shows the commit history of your repository.
- Only displays commits that are part of the current branch’s history.
- Good for seeing what has been committed to the project.
- Example: git log --oneline
git reflog :
---------------
- Shows the history of HEAD movements (where your HEAD and branches pointed to).
- Includes commits that may not be visible in git log (like after reset, rebase, checkout, etc.).
- Useful for recovering lost commits.
- Example: git reflog

(28) How do you check who wrote a particular line of code in a file? (git blame)?
###################################################################################
This is where git blame comes in.
command : git blame <filename>
Shows who last modified each line in a file, along with:
                                                      - commit hash
                                                      - author
                                                      - timestamp
                                                      - the actual line of code
                                                                             Example : git blame UserService.java










###################################################################################################################################################################
                                                                                 Git Commands
####################################################################################################################################################################

1. git init
________________
Purpose: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

Usage: You run this command in a project folder to convert it into a Git repository. It creates a .git directory where Git stores all its configuration files and version history.

Example:
git init
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
2. git status
_______________
Purpose: Shows the current status of the working directory and staging area.
Usage: This command is used to check whether there are any modified, added, or deleted files in the working directory that need to be staged or committed.

git status

It will show if files are untracked, modified, or staged.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3. git add
_______________

Purpose: Adds files or changes to the staging area (index) in preparation for a commit.
Usage: You specify the file(s) to add or use a wildcard (e.g., git add . to add all files).


git add test.txt
git add .  # To add all changes
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4 git commit
_______________
Purpose: Commits the staged files to the local repository, saving your changes along with a commit message.
Usage: This records your staged changes and adds them to the local repository’s history.

git commit -m "Commit message describing changes"
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5) git push
_______________
Purpose: Pushes the committed changes from the local repository to the central repository (remote repo like GitHub).
Usage: After committing locally, use this to share your changes with others by sending them to the central repository.

git push origin main  # Push changes to the "main" branch

**Note**: 

Git will:

-> Create a remote named origin

-> Create a local branch named testing (instead of main)

-> Set up tracking: testing → origin/testing

-> that's the reason to use : git push origin testing  # Push changes to the "testing" branch

-> to check remote: git remote -v

Note: before commiting also we can see branch if not showing git branch then use, git symbolic-ref --short HEAD


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6) git restore
_______________
Purpose: Used to undo changes in the working directory and the staging area but at least one commit needed.
Usage:
(1) If a file is unstaged, git restore will discard local changes made to that file.
Examples:

git restore test.txt

(2) If a file is staged, git restore --staged will unstage the file but keep the changes in the working directory.
Unstage a staged file (without discarding changes):

Examples:
git restore --staged test.txt


EXTRA:-

| Your goal                           | Best command           | Needs commit?  |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------  |
| Unstage a file                      | `git reset <file>`     | ❌ No          |
| Discard local (uncommitted) changes | `git restore <file>`   | ✅ Yes         |
| Unstage using `restore`             | `git restore --staged` | ✅ Yes         |
| Revert committed changes            | `git revert <commit>`  | ✅ Yes         |


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
7) git log
__________
Purpose: Displays the commit history, including commit IDs, author information, dates, and commit messages.
Usage: This is useful to view the history of changes made to the project.

git log

To view a simpler summary, you can add options:

git log --oneline

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
8) git rm
_______________
Purpose: Removes a file from both the working directory and the staging area, and it schedules the deletion for the next commit.
Usage: If you want to delete a file, this command removes it and stages the change for the commit.

git rm file_name.txt
git commit -m "Remove test.txt"
git push origin main
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

9) git clone
_______________
Purpose: Downloads a copy of an existing Git repository (usually from a remote central repository) to your local system.
Usage: This command is typically used when you want to start working on an existing project and need a copy of the central repository on your machine.

git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

10) git pull
_______________
Purpose: Fetches and merges changes from the central repository to your local repository.
Usage: Use this to keep your local repository up to date with changes made by other collaborators. However, conflicts may arise if your local changes clash with those on the central repo.

git pull origin main

Note: Conflicts occur when there are changes in the same part of a file in both your local and the central repository. You’ll need to manually resolve these conflicts.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

11) git gui
_______________
Purpose: Opens the Git GUI tool, which is a graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with Git repositories.
Usage: Some users prefer to use a GUI rather than the command line to manage their repositories. The git gui tool provides a more visual interface for Git operations like commit, branch, and status management.

Example: git gui

This will open a graphical tool where you can perform many of the Git operations like staging, committing, and viewing the commit history without needing to use
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


git pull versus git fetch
___________________________
a. git pull

-> Downloads changes from the remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to the local repository.
-> Automatically merges the fetched changes into your current working branch.
-> May cause merge conflicts if there are conflicting change

Example:
git pull
_______________

b. git fetch
_______________
-> Downloads the latest changes from the remote repository but does not merge them into your working branch.
-> This is a safe operation because it allows you to review the changes before merging.
-> The fetched changes are stored in origin/<branch>, and you can manually merge them when ready.

Example:
git fetch
git merge

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
12. git stash:
_______________
-> git stash is a command used in Git to temporarily save changes that are not yet committed to work on something else without losing your modifications. but make sure at least once commit has been done.
-> when you run git stash, all your modified but unstaged or staged changes are temporarily stored in a hidden area

example: 
| Command                      | Description                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `git stash push a.txt`       | ✅ Stashes **only `a.txt`**, if it's a tracked or staged file                         |
| `git stash push a.txt b.txt` | ✅ Stashes **only those specific files**                                              |
| `git stash`                  | ✅ Stashes **all modified tracked** and **staged files**, but **not untracked** files |
| `git stash -u`               | ✅ Stashes tracked **+ untracked** files                                              |
| `git stash pop`              | ✅ Applies the **most recent stash** and **removes it** from the stash list           |
| `git stash list`             | ✅ Lists **all saved stashes**                                                        |
| `git stash apply`            | ✅ Applies the most recent stash **without deleting** it from the list                |




13. git cherrypic:
__________________
-> git cherry-pick is used to apply a specific commit from one branch to another without merging the entire branch.

Interview Question?

You have done today 5 commits, but you want to merge only 3rd commit to particular branch, how will you do?
Answer: git cherrypic

Note: git merge will merge all the commit to a particular branch

-------------
PRACTICAL :
------------
Step 1: Create a new repo:
-> git init
Step 2: Create initial commit on main:
-> git add .
-> git commit -m "initial commit"
Step 3: Create and switch to a new branch:
-> git checkout -b feature
Step 4: Make 5 commits :

echo "first change" >> file.txt
git add .
git commit -m "commit 1"

echo "second change" >> file.txt
git add .
git commit -m "commit 2"

echo "third change" >> file.txt
git add .
git commit -m "commit 3"

echo "fourth change" >> file.txt
git add .
git commit -m "commit 4"

echo "fifth change" >> file.txt
git add .
git commit -m "commit 5"

Step 5: View the commit history and copy the hash of commit 3:
-> git log --oneline
Step 6: Switch back to main :
-> git checkout main
Step 7: Cherry-pick the 3rd commit only :
-> git cherry-pick c1d2345
Step 8 : You can verify :
-> git log --oneline
-> cat file.txt

BRANCHES:=
#################################

* Instead of saying Merge the branch in cmpny ppl say do PR

* How Much Branches was there in your projects: 
- features (for adding new features)
- R & D ( for adding some extra thing to make better application)
- Hot fix ( serious problem)
- bug fix ( for fixing bugs)
.... etc

* How many branches you have created ( at a given time )
1 ,2 or 3
* tell me procedure to fix a bug ?
firstly from bug fix branch , i created one more branch (sub branch) like bug-fix-jira-3456-login-error and work in this branch , once after fixed bug
then i have done PR (pull request) 

(1) To see local branches (on your machine):

 git branch

(2)  To see remote branches (on the remote like GitHub, GitLab, etc.):
 
 git branch -r

(3)  To see all branches (both local and remote):

 git branch -a

(4) To switch to an existing branch:
 
 git switch <branch-name>    / git checkout <branch-name>

(5) To create a new branch and switch to it:

 git switch -c <new-branch-name>  / git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

(6) to create new branch through git :
 
 git branch <branch-name>    / git branch bug-fix-jira-3456-login-error
(7)  by your self created branch , git push will not work instead use this one : git push --set-upstream origin bug-fix-jira-3456-login-error

PULL CONFLICT := when two developers are working on same functionality and there code are not matching on a particular line of code then it's occurs 
                for that while doing pull we need to fix it manually.

* Note:- write same line different code on git hub code and different line in local then 
(8) git add .
(9) git commit -m "first commit"
(10) git pull :- you will see conflict error so manually fix and then repeat above 3 commands then
(11) git push


* Note: if you want to set your origin then : git remote set-url origin https://github.com/mera786/test.git

(12) Undo the commit from remote repository: git revert <commit-id>  / git revert aac5cba

(13) Undo the commit from local repository : 
 soft reset : it will only undo from stagging to unstage but file will be there 
git reset --soft HEAD~1 (for recent commit)

hard reset : it will undo from stagging and also removed file.
git reset --hard HEAD~3

(14) difference between revert and reset :
git revert : 
-> revert adds a new commit.
git reset :
-> reset removes history (risky if pushed).

| Feature                      | `git revert` | `git reset`                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| Safe for shared branches     | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No                        |
| Removes commits from history | ❌ No         | ✅ Yes                       |
| Creates a new commit         | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No (unless `--soft` used) |

REVERT practical :
 Step 1: Create a repo and add some commits:
git init revert-demo
cd revert-demo

echo "line 1" > file.txt
git add .
git commit -m "commit 1"

echo "line 2" >> file.txt
git add .
git commit -m "commit 2"

echo "line 3" >> file.txt
git add .
git commit -m "commit 3"

Step 2: See history :
git log --oneline

 Step 3: Revert commit 2 :
git revert b2f3abc
